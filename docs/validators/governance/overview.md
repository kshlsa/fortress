# Governance Overview

The Fortress has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing
text proposals, changing [chain parameters](./param_change), and spending [funds from the community pool](./community_pool).

## On- and off-chain Governance Structure

### Communication

Governance practices and decisions are communicated through different types of documents and design artifacts:

- On-chain governance [proposals](https://www.mintscan.io/fortress/proposals)
- Architecture Decision records
- Technical standards / specifications

### Decision-making and Discussion Venues

Venues involve community members to different degrees and individuals often perform multiple roles in the Cosmos ecosystem (validators, users, developers and core-members of Fortress Team). Because technical direction setting and development is almost always happening in the open, involvement from members in the extended community occurs organically.
